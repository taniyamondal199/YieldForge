# YieldForge
YieldForge is a DeFi-native protocol on Mantle that converts real-world asset cash flows into composable yield tokens. Using ERC-4626 vaults, it splits deposits into Principal and Yield tokens, enabling tradable yield with privacy-preserving compliance via ZK-KYC and oracle-driven updates.
